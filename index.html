          The Audi 100 was launched in 1968, followed by the Audi 80/Fox in 1972
          (which served as the basis for the 1973 Volkswagen Passat), and the
          Audi 50 (later renamed the Volkswagen Polo) in 1974. The Audi 50 was
          an original design as it was the first incarnation of the Golf/Polo
          concept, resulting in a hugely successful car around the world.
          Ultimately, the Audi 80 and 100 (predecessors to the A4 and A6,
          respectively) became the company's best-selling models, while little
          investment was made in the dying NSU range: the Prinz models ceased
          production in 1973, and the deadly NSU Ro 80 bug disappeared from
          produced in 1977, effectively burying the NSU brand. Production of the
          Audi 100 gradually moved from Ingolstadt to Neckarsulm throughout the
          1970s with the introduction of the second generation C2 of the earlier
          models in 1976, all production at the former NSU plant. From that
          moment on, Neckarsulm made it possible to produce high-end Audi
          models.<a
